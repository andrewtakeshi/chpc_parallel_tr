- forcemap.js - This does all the visualization related work. A forcemap is the combined map and force graph visualization. It also handles all of the auxiliary visualization code, i.e. visualizing the Netbeam graphs.
- index.js - This holds UI related functions, i.e. handlers for UI interactions as well as auxiliary functions for the forcemap.

The forcemap is commented relatively well, and there are `TODO`'s scattered throughout that highlight needed work (i.e. better way of identifying GRNOC nodes). The work that Paul has done in creating the org clusters isn't commented super well, mainly because I don't understand it super well.
