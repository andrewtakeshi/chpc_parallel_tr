abstract="We present a system, called TPlay, for the visualization of the traceroutes performed by the Internet probes deployed by active measurement projects. These traceroutes are continuously executed towards selected Internet targets. TPlay allows to look at traceroutes at different abstraction levels and to animate the evolution of traceroutes during a selected time interval. The system has been extensively tested on traceroutes performed by RIPE Atlas [22] Internet probes.",
