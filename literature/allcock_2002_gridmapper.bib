abstract={Grid applications can combine the use of computation, storage, network, and other resources. These resources are often geographically distributed, adding to application complexity and thus the difficulty of understanding application performance. We present GridMapper, a tool for monitoring and visualizing the behavior of such distributed systems. GridMapper builds on basic mechanisms for registering, discovering, and accessing performance information sources, as well as for mapping from domain names to physical locations. The visualization system itself then supports the automatic layout of distributed sets of such sources and animation of their activities. We use a set of examples to illustrate how the system can provide valuable insights into the behavior and performance of a range of different applications.},
